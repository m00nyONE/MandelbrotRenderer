# MandelbrotRenderer
A small and simple MandelbrotRenderer I built in c++ with SDL2

you need the SDL Libary's to Run and compile the program. you can find them here: https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

If you have an idea about better zooming ( i.e with the mouse or keyboard) , performance increase or anything else, please let me know.
Just do a pull request or send me a PM. I want it to be cross platform. so no windos.h or anything like that please.

This is my first program with the SDL libary.
